See the risk factor Ò The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property right sÓ in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10 -Q under the heading ÒRisk Factors.Ó The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2016 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the CompanyÕs financial condition or ope rating results.
Risk Factors The following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors a ssociated with the CompanyÕs business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10 -K and in Part II, Item 1A of the Form 10 -Q for the quarters ended December 26, 2015 and March 26, 2016, in each case under the heading ÒRisk Factors.Ó The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a numbe r of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause th e CompanyÕs actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results.
Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the CompanyÕs busines s, financial condition, operating results and stock price.
There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.
The success of new product introductions depends on a numbe r of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the CompanyÕs ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp -up issues, the availability of application software for new prod ucts, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction.
While the Company has entered into agreements for t he supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.
The Company relies on access to third -party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managementÕs expectations, the CompanyÕs consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the CompanyÕs products and services less attractive to the CompanyÕs customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices.
The CompanyÕs business is subject to the risks of international operations.
The CompanyÕs retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources a nd are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
